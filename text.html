    <p>How many sentences are in a paragraph? It is important to note that there is a great deal of variety in how long a paragraph is and there is not a minimum or maximum number of sentences that it must have to fit its definition. Some writers will opt to use very short paragraphs, while others will include dozens of sentences in their paragraphs. It is also important to know that most writers separate lines of dialogue into paragraphs, so if a character only speaks a single line, it will be its own paragraph.

        Keeping that in mind, there is a general agreement on the format of a standard paragraph, which especially applies to informational and argumentative or persuasive writing. A paragraph should be divided into three distinct sections that each serve a purpose to the paragraph as a whole.</p>
